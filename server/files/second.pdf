The face of the country presents considerable diversity, although its
general character, except the southern partsl is extremely abrupt and
mountainous. The coast, for a short distance a long the borders of the lake is
generally flat: retreating from it, the surface immediately becomes unequal,
roughening into slopes which gradually combine and swell into the mountainous
amphitheatre that bounds it on the east, where it falls precipitately, but
terminates less abruptly on the south. The collected villages waving plains,
palmyra topes and extensive cultivation of Nanchanad resemble inevery
particular the neightbouring province of Tirnelvelly, except that in no measure
partakes of its comparative arid sterility.Approaching northward this fertile plain
is succeeded by the woody and rugged surface of the genuine ‘Malayalam’ some
few champaign tracts enclosed within this ocean of forest relieve the uniformity
of the sylvan scene.The extent lining the coast for its whole length presents
fertility so near the sea that it imparts a peculiar character to the landscape.This
rich and variegated tract is flanked by a mountainous barrier and is finally
contrasted with the somber magnificence and desolate solitude of those wilds of
which the elephant seems the natural inaster; and though the landscape may be
too much made up of this wild scenery, it boasts of many striking localities and
peculiar beauties, if not the sublime, at least romantic and picturesque
kinds.The dye is arrested by the wild, rocky, precipitous acclivities and fantastic
forms assumed by the mountains in the more southern parts; but proceeding
north the bold and elevated contour of the alpine tract is less sharply defined; a
few rugged cliffs and spiry points or conical summits alone breaking through the
sameness of its rounded and somber outline.This Apennine dissolves into
clustering hills and romantic inequalities at whose feet wind innumerable valleys
presenting (particularly in the middle parts) the most delightful landscapes
whose natural beauties are embellished and diversified by the prospect of
churches and pagodas.Indeed, the endless succession of houses and gardens
scattered in picturesque order over the face of the country gives it entirely a
