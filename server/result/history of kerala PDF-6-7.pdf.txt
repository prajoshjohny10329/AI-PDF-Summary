 Kerala, the southernmost state of India, is unique in its location along the Arabian Sea and is bounded by Karnataka and Tamil Nadu states. It stretches for approximately 580 km and has a population of 25.4 million people, making up 3.71% of India's population. Kerala's geographical position, a narrow strip of land between the Western Ghats and the sea, has influenced its history by giving it insularity and protecting it from political convulsions and foreign invasions that affected northern India. This isolation led to the evolution of unique social institutions like the matrilineal system and distinctive arts and architecture in Kerala. Historical contacts with the Roman Empire and other foreign countries, particularly through trading activities and cultural exchanges, have been proven since ancient times.
