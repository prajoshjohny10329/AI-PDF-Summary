 Kerala, the southmost state of India, occupying a unique position along the Arabian Sea, has a distinctive geographical location. The state's narrow expanse, measuring approximately 580 km in length and 32-120 km in breadth, is hemmed between the Western Ghats and the Arabian Sea. Kerala's area of 38,863 sq.kms ranks it as the seventeenth largest state in India, accounting for 1.19% of the country's total area. Its population, comprising 25.4 million people or 3.71% of India's total population, has significantly influenced the state's history due to its geographical insularity. This isolation allowed Kerala to develop unique social institutions like matrilineal inheritance and distinctive styles of art and architecture, such as Kathakali, which set it apart from other parts of India. Historical contacts with foreign countries, primarily centered around trading activities and cultural exchanges, date back to ancient times, with Roman influence being proven beyond doubt.
